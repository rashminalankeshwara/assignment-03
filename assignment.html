            <H1 class="anim">Let's Talk About</br> Guitar</H1>
            <p class="anim" >There are three main types of modern guitar: the classical guitar (Spanish guitar);
                 the steel-string acoustic guitar or electric guitar; and the Hawaiian guitar (played across the player's lap).
                  Traditional acoustic guitars include the flat top guitar (typically with a large sound hole) or an archtop guitar,
                   which is sometimes called a "jazz guitar". The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings' vibration, 
                   amplified by the hollow body of the guitar, which acts as a resonating chamber. The classical Spanish guitar is often played as a solo instrument using a comprehensive fingerstyle technique where each string is plucked individually by the player's fingers, 
                   as opposed to being strummed. The term "finger-picking" can also refer to a specific tradition of folk, blues, bluegrass, and country guitar playing in the United States.
